\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection*{General notations} 
$\Nat$ stands for the set of natural numbers. For $k \in \Nat$, let $[k] = \{1,\dots, k\}$. For a vector $\vec{x}=(x_1,\dots, x_n)$, let $|\vec{x}|$ denote the length of $\vec{x}$ (i.e., $n$), and for each $i \in [n]$, let $\vec{x}(i)$ denote $x_i$. For a vector $\vec{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$, let $\red(\vec{x})$ denote $(x_{i_1},\dots, x_{i_m})$ such that for each $j \in [m]$, $x_{i_j}$ is different from all $x_1, \dots, x_{i_j-1}$.
\tl{red is for reduced?}
The term DAG stands for \emph{directed acylic graphs}.

\subsection*{Regular language}
Fix a finite alphabet $\Sigma$. Elements in $\Sigma^*$ are called words or strings interchangeably. $\Sigma^+$ comprises words that are not empty. For a finite word $u \in \Sigma^+$, let $|u|$ denote the length of $u$, in addition, for $i \in [|u|]$, let $u[i]$ the $i$-th letter of $u$.

\begin{definition}[Regular expressions $\regexp$]
	\[e \eqdef a \mid e + e \mid e \concat e \mid e^\ast, \mbox{ where } a \in \Sigma. \]
	We also use the abbreviations $\Sigma \equiv \cup_{a \in \Sigma}\ a$ and $\Sigma^\ast \equiv (\cup_{a \in \Sigma}\ a)^\ast$.
\end{definition}

We use $\Ll(e)$ to denote the set of strings that match $e$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hide{
	A regular expression $e$ is said to be \emph{bounded} if $e$ is defined by the rules, $e \eqdef a \mid u^\ast \mid e \concat e$, where $u$ is a constant string. For instance, $a (bc)^\ast$ is bounded, while $(ab^\ast)^\ast$ is not. A regular expression $e$ is a union of bounded regular expressions if $e = e_1 + \dots + e_k$ such that each $e_i$ is a bounded regular expression. We use UBR to abbreviate the set of regular expressions which are a union of bounded regular expressions.
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) $\cA$ on $\Sigma$ is a tuple $(Q, \delta, q_0, F)$, where $Q$ is a finite set of states, $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state, $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of final states, and $\delta \subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times Q$ is the transition relation. An NFA $\cA$ is deterministic if for each $(q, \sigma) \in Q \times \Sigma$, there is at most one $q' \in Q$ such that $(q, a, q') \in \delta$. An NFA $\cA$ is complete if for each $(q, \sigma) \in Q \times \Sigma$, there is at least one $q' \in Q$ such that $(q, a, q') \in \delta$. We assume that all NFA considered in this paper are complete. For a string $w = \sigma_1 \dots \sigma_n$, a run of $\cA$ on $w$ is a sequence $q_0 \dots q_n$ such that for each $i \in [n]$, $(q_{i-1}, \sigma_i, q_i) \in \delta$. A run $q_0 \dots q_n$ is accepting if $q_n \in F$. A string $w$ is accepted by $\cA$ if there is an accepting run of $\cA$ on $w$. An NFA $\cA$ is \emph{unambiguous} if for each word $w$, there is \emph{at most one accepting} run of $\cA$ on $w$.
We also use the notation $q_1 \xrightarrow[\cA]{w} q_{n+1}$ to denote the fact that there are $q_2,\dots, q_n \in Q$ such that for each $i \in [n]$, $(q_i, \sigma_i, q_{i+1}) \in \delta$.  For an NFA $\cA=(Q, \delta, q_0, F)$ and $q, q' \in Q$, we use $\cA(q,q')$ to denote the NFA which is obtained from $\cA$ by changing the initial state to $q$ and the set of final states to $\{q'\}$.

\subsection*{Computational complexity}
In this paper, we study not only decidability but also the complexity of string logics. Pinpointing the
precise complexity of verification problems is not only of fundamental
importance, but also it often suggests algorithmic techniques
that are most suitable for attacking the problem in practice.
In this paper, we deal with the following computational complexity
classes (see \cite{} for more details): P (problems solvable
in polynomial-time), PSPACE (problems solvable in polynomial
space and exponential time), and EXPSPACE (problems solvable
in exponential space and double exponential time). Verification
problems that have complexity PSPACE or beyond — see [40, 60]
for a few examples — have substantially benefited from techniques
like symbolic model checking \cite{}. As we shall see later, our complexity
upper bound also suggests the maximum lengths of words
that need to be explored to guarantee completeness.

\section{The core constraint language}

In this section, we define a general string constraint language that supports concatenations and the replaceAll function.  Throughout this section, we fix an alphabet $\Sigma$.



\subsection{Semantics of the function $\replaceall$}
To define the semantics of the $\replaceall$ function, we note that the function has three parameters: the first parameter is the subject string, the second parameter is a pattern that is a regular expression in general. The third parameter is the replacement.  The most interesting case is when the second parameter is  a regular expression. However, there is no consensus on the semantics even for mainstream programming language such as Python and Javascript where replaceall functions are extensively used. This is particularly the case when interpreting the union operator in regular expressions. In this paper we follow the POSIX standard, and mainly focus on the following semantics. Intuitively we consider the first and longest match. 


\begin{definition}
Given two strings $u,v$, a regular expression $e$, we say $u$ is the \emph{first and longest} match of $e$ in $v$ if $v=x'uz$ and the following two conditions hold
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $u \in \Ll(e)$,  and $x' u' \not \in  \Ll(\Sigma^\ast e \Sigma^\ast)$ for every strict prefix $u'$ of $u$, 
	\item for every nonempty prefix $z'$ of $z$, $u z' \not \in \Ll(e)$,
\end{enumerate} 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
The semantics of $\replaceall(x, e, y)$, where $\Ll(e) \subseteq \Sigma^+$, is defined inductively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item if $x \not \in \Ll(\Sigma^\ast e \Sigma^\ast)$, i.e., $x$ does \emph{not} contain any word in $\Ll(e)$ as a substring, then $\replaceall(x, e, y) = x$, 
	%
	\item otherwise, let $x = x' u z$ such that $u$ is the \emph{first and longest} match of $e$ in $v$.  Then $\replaceall(x, e, y) = x' y \cdot \replaceall(z, e, y)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
For instance, let $e = a^+$, then $\replaceall(aaabaac, a^+, y)=ybyc$.
\end{example}

%\begin{remark}
%Follows the POSIX standard. Different from Javascript.
%\end{remark}
%
%\tl{Anthony mentioned that there might be alternatives, for instance,  $\replaceall$ can be made nondeterministic ($\replaceall(aaaaa, aaa, y) = \{yaa, aya, aay\}$). This MIGHT be considered as well.}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hide{
The semantics of $\replaceall(x, u, y)$ is defined inductively as follows: let $u = u_1 \dots u_k$ (where $k \ge 1$),
\begin{itemize}
	\item if $x \not \in \Sigma^\ast u \Sigma^\ast$, then $\replaceall(x, u, y) = x$, 
	%
	\item otherwise, let $x = x' u z$ such that $x' u_1 \dots u_{k-1} \not \in \Sigma^\ast u \Sigma^\ast$, then $\replaceall(x, u, y) = x' v \cdot \replaceall(z, u, y)$.
\end{itemize}
For instance, $\replaceall(aaaaa, aaa, y) = yaa$, and $\replaceall("Jeve", e, a) = Java$.

\tl{Anthony mentioned that there might be alternatives, for instance,  $\replaceall$ can be made nondeterministic ($\replaceall(aaaaa, aaa, y) = \{yaa, aya, aay\}$). This MIGHT be considered as well.}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hide{
	\smallskip
	
	\noindent The semantics of $split(x, u)$ is defined inductively as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if $x \not \in \Sigma^\ast u \Sigma^\ast$, then $split(x,u) = x$, 
		%
		\item otherwise, let $x = y u z$ such that $y \not \in \Sigma^\ast u \Sigma^\ast$, then $split(x, u) = concat([y], split(z, u))$, where $[y]$ is the array comprising one element $y$ and $concat$ operation concatenates two arrays into one.  
	\end{itemize} 
	
	For instance, $split("Java", a) = [``J", ``v", ``"]$.
	
	\smallskip
	
	\noindent The semantics of $join(X)$ is defined inductively as follows: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if $X$ is the empty array, then $join(X) = ``''$,  
		\item otherwise, let $X= concat([x], Y)$, then $join(X) = x\ \cdot\ ``," \ \cdot\ join(Y)$.
	\end{itemize}
	For instance, $join([``Tom", ``John", ``Henry"]) =``Tom,John,Henry"$.

\subsection{The straight-line string fragment}



We consider the following data types: String data type $\str$, Integer data type $\intnum$, and Array of strings $\str [\ ]$. \tl{I do not think we need $\str[]$, right?}


We assume a countably set of variables, of data types form $\dtypes$. We will use $x, y, z, \dots$ to denote the variables of data type $\str$, and $n, n', \dots$ to denote the variables of type $\intnum$. 

In addition, we use $X, Y, Z, \dots$ to denote the variables of data type $\str[\ ]$.

We use $u, v, w, \dots$ to denote the constant strings, and $c, c',\dots$ to denote the constant integers.



\begin{definition}[Relational and regular constraints with $\replaceall$ function]
	Relational constraints and regular constraints are defined by the following rules,
	\[
	\begin{array}{r c l cr}
	s &\eqdef & x \mid u & \ \ & \mbox{(string terms)}\\
	r &\eqdef & x \mid e & \ \ & \mbox{(regular expression terms)}\\
	%t &\eqdef & s \mid e & \ \ & \mbox{(terms)}\\
	\varphi &\eqdef & x = s \concat s  \mid  x = \replaceall(s, r, s) \mid \varphi \wedge \varphi & \ \ & \mbox{(relational constraints)}\\
	\psi & \eqdef & x \in e \mid \psi \wedge \psi \mid \psi \vee \psi \mid \neg \psi   & \ \ & \mbox{(regular constraints)} \\
	\end{array}
	\]
	where $u \in \Sigma^\ast$ and $e$ is a regular expression. 
	
	
	\tl{can the regular constraints be simplified to just a conjunction of $x\in e$?}
	%A regular constraint $\psi$ is a UBR constraint if for each atom $x \in e$ occurring in $\psi$, $e$ is in UBR.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rem-concat}
The concatenation modality $x = s \concat s$ is redundant in the sense that $x = s_1 \concat s_2$ can be rewritten as $x' = \replaceall(ab, a, s_1), x = \replaceall(x', b, s_2)$, where $a,b$ are two fresh letters.
\end{remark}
\tl{I suggest not put this remark here.}


For a formula $\varphi$, let $\vars(\varphi)$ denote the set of variables occurring in $\varphi$. Similarly for $\vars(\psi)$.



Given a relational constraint $\varphi$, a variable $x$ (of type $\str$) is called a \emph{source variable} of $\varphi$ if $\varphi$ \emph{does not} contain a conjunct of the form $x = s_1 \concat \dots \concat s_n$ or $x = \replaceall(\dots)$.

 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hide{
	\begin{definition}[Dependency graph]
		Let $\varphi$ be a relational constraint with $\replaceall$ function. Then the dependency graph of $\varphi$, denoted by $\cG_\varphi = (\vars(\varphi), E_\varphi)$, where $E_\varphi$ comprises the following edges,
		\begin{itemize}
			\item for each atomic formula $y= s_1 \concat \dots \concat s_n$ and each $i \in [n]$ such that $s_i$ is a variable, $(s_i, y) \in E_\varphi$,
			\item for each atomic formula $x = \replaceall(y, u, s)$, $(y, x) \in E_\varphi$, in addition, if $s$ is a variable, then $(s, x) \in E_\varphi$, $(s, y) \in E_\varphi$, 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{definition}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The generality of the constraint language makes it undecidable,
even in very simple cases. To retain decidability, we follow \cite{LB16} and focus on the ``strainght-line fragment" of the language. This straight-line fragment captures the structure of straight-line manipulating
programs with concatenations and replaceall as atomic string operations.  

\begin{definition}[Straight-line relational constraints with $\replaceall$ function]
	A relational constraint $ \varphi$ with $\replaceall$ function is straight-line, if $\varphi \eqdef \bigwedge \limits_{1 \le i \le m} x_i = P_i$ such that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $x_1,\dots, x_m$ are mutually distinct,
		\item for each $i \in [m]$, all the variables in $P_i$ are either source variables, or variables from $\{x_1,\dots, x_{i-1}\}$,
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Intuitively, in a straight-line relational constraint, the dependency graph of the string variables is acyclic.


\begin{definition}[Straight-line string constraints with $\replaceall$ function]
	A straight-line string constraint $C$ with $\replaceall$ function (denoted by $\strline[\replaceall]$)  is defined as $ \varphi \wedge \psi$,  where 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\varphi$ is a straight-line relational constraint,  and
		%
		\item $\psi$ is a regular constraint.
		%
	\end{itemize}
	%Let us use $\Cc$ to denote the set of straight-line string constraints with $\replaceall$ function.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Checking whether a relational constraint $\varphi$ can be made a straight-line constraint can be done in linear time. 
\end{remark}

By Remark~\ref{rem-concat}, without loss of generality, we assume that 
in each $\strline[\replaceall]$ constraint $\varphi \wedge \psi$, the concatenation symbol $\concat$ does not occur in $\varphi$. 
\tl{as mentioned, here I suggest that here we just provide a clean def of language}

%Let us use $\pstrline[\replaceall]$ to denote the set of pure $\strline[\replaceall]$ constraints.

%\medskip

\subsection{Satisfiability problem} 
\begin{quote}
\framebox{Given an $\strline[\replaceall]$ constraint $C$, decide whether $C$ is satisfiable.}

\smallskip

The questions we plan to consider is summarised in the following table. Note that for $x=\replaceall (y,u,z)$, $y$ is referred to as a \emph{pattern} and $z$ is referred to as a \emph{replacement}.

\[
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c}
\hline
pattern (e)  &   replacement (z)        & complexity \\
\hline
constant string  &   constant   string                    & PSPACE-c (\cite{LB16})     \\
\hline
regular expression  &   constant string                      &    PSPACE-c (\cite{LB16}) ?     \\

\hline
constant string  &   variable                       & PSPACE-c (Section \ref{sec:replaceallsl})       \\

\hline
regular expression  &   variable                       &           \\
\hline
variable &   constant string/variable                       &    undecidable       \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\]



\begin{definition}[Dependency graph]
	Let $C= \varphi \wedge \psi$ be an $\strline[\replaceall]$ formula such that $\vars(\varphi) = \{x_1,\dots, x_m, y_1, \dots, y_n\}$, where $y_1,\dots, y_n$ are  source variables. Define the \emph{dependency graph} of $C$ as $G_C= (\vars(\varphi), E_C)$, such that for each $i \in [m]$, if $x_i = \replaceall(z, e_i, z')$, then $(x_i, (\rpleft, e_i), z) \in E_C$ and $(x_i, (\rpright, e_i), z') \in E_C$. A final (resp. initial) vertex in $G_C$ is a vertex in $G_C$ without successors (resp. predecessors). The edges labeled by $(\rpleft, e_i)$ and $(\rpright, e_i)$ are called the $\rpleft$-edges and $\rpright$-edges respectively. 
	%The $\rpleft$-length of a path $\pi$, denoted by $\rpleftlen(\pi)$, is the number of $\rpleft$-edges on $\pi$. A path of $G_C$ is a sequence $z_1 \ell_1 z_2 \dots \ell_{k-1} z_k$ such that for each $i \in [k-1]$, $(z_i, \ell_i, z_{i+1}) \in E_C$. A path is initial (resp. final) if the path starts from an initial vertex (resp. stops at a final vertex).
	% e the $\src$-nesting-depth of $z$ in $G_C$, denoted by $\srcnd_{G_C}(z)$,  as the maximum number of $\src$-edges in paths from source variables to $z$.
\end{definition}
Note that $G_C$ is a DAG (directed acyclic graph) where the out-degree of each vertex is two or zero.
