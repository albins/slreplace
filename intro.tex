\section{Introduction}

We have seen  a lot of work on solvers for constraint languages over strings (a.k.a. string solvers). 

One main driving force behind this research direction is the application to analysis of security vulnerability in web applications against code injections and cross-site scripting (XSS), which are typically caused by improper handling of untrusted strings by the web applications, e.g., leading to an execution of malicious JavaScript in the clients' browsers. 

$\replaceall$ function is widely used in Javascript programs.

\cite{LB16,TCJ16,YABI14}

unrestricted $\replaceall$ function: undecidable, even the third parameter is a constant string

to regain decidability: straight-line constraint

an extensive investigation on straight-line string constraints with $\replaceall$ function. 


The logic chain would be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item string constraints are important;
	\item the replaceall function is extensively used, so solving string constraints with replaceall function is important
	\item the current technique \cite{LB16} can only address replaceall with one variable in parameters, but this is not enough
	\item we carry out a systematic investigation of replaceall when other parameters can be set as variables 
\end{itemize}
