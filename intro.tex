\section{Introduction}

We have seen  a lot of work on solvers for constraint languages over strings (a.k.a. string solvers). 

One main driving force behind this research direction is the application to analysis of security vulnerability in web applications against code injections and cross-site scripting (XSS), which are typically caused by improper handling of untrusted strings by the web applications, e.g., leading to an execution of malicious JavaScript in the clients' browsers. 

$\replaceall$ function is widely used in Javascript programs.

unrestricted $\replaceall$ function: undecidable, even the third parameter is a constant string

to regain decidability: straight-line constraint

an extensive investigation on straight-line string constraints with $\replaceall$ function.
