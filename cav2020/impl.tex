Written in Scala.

Extension of NFA to CEFA. Extend the Class $State$, transition set $\delta(q) \subseteq  \Sigma \times Q$ changed into  $\delta(q) \subseteq \Sigma \times Q \times \Int^k$. 

reduce the number of registers
\begin{itemize}
\item $\substring(x, 0, i)$, remove the input register,
%
\item CEFAs without registers: product + minimization 

CEFAs with one register updated with $+1$: product + minimization

Other CEFAs: no optimization
\end{itemize}

$prefixOf(x, u), suffixOf(x,u), contains(x, u)$: transformed into regular constraints

using nuxmv to avoid state explosion of the product operation.
