string operations with integer data type

state-of-the-art: heuristics

The contribution of this paper: decision procedure for string constraints involving integer data type

automata-theoretic, cost-enriched regular languages and recognisable relations, backward computation

implementation OSTRICH+, experimental results promising

first decision procedure for such an expressive class of string constraints involving so many different operations, natural extension of the decision procedure of OSTRICH, efficient implementation, extensive experiments,
