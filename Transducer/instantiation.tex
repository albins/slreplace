\subsection{Two-way transducers}\label{sec-2way}

%Let $\Transducer$ be a 2PT with $k$ parameters $y_1,\cdots, y_k$ and $\Aut$ be an NFA. Then the \emph{preimage} of $\Aut$ w.r.t. $\Transducer$, denoted by $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, is the set of tuples $(w, w_1,\cdots, w_k)$ such that there is an accepting run of $\Transducer$ on $w$ producing an output $w' \in \Lang(\Aut)$, equipped with the parameters $w_1,\cdots, w_k$.


\begin{lemma}\label{lem-2pt}
Let $\Transducer$ be a 2PT and $\Aut$ be a succinctly encoded NFA $\Aut$. Then $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ is a recognisable relation. Moreover, a representation of $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, whose atom size is bounded by $2^{O(|\Transducer||\Aut|\log (|\Transducer||\Aut|))}$, can be computed effectively.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume a 2PT $\Transducer=(X, Q, q_0, F, \delta)$ with $X = \{x_1,\cdots, x_k\}$ and a succinctly encoded NFA $\Aut = ((Q', \delta'), S)$ with $S \subseteq Q' \times Q'$. %We first introduce some notations.

To compute $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, we use a notation $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k}}$. 
%and $\Aut[S]$ defined below.

Suppose $S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k} \subseteq Q' \times Q'$ and $q \in F$. %\tl{$Q$ should be $Q'$?}
%
Then $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k}, q}$ is the NFA constructed from $\Transducer$  by checking that there is an accepting run of $T$ on $w$, ending in the state $q$, and simulating an accepting run of $\Aut$ on the output of $\Transducer$. In particular, when the a transition of $\Transducer$ outputs $x_i$ (instead of a single letter), a pair of states $(q_1', q_2')$ will be nondeterministically selected from $S_{x_i}$, and the component of the state of $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k}, q}$ corresponding to $\Aut_1$ will be updated from $q_1'$ to $q_2'$ to mimic a possible instantiation of $x_i$.  

%\tl{zhilin, I am not quite clear about the para, $y_1$ is a typo of $x_1$? I wrote a para above; please check}
%(instead of materialising the output), where $S_{x_1}$ is used to jump over $y_1$ when $x_1$ is the output of a transition of $\Transducer$, similarly for $S_{x_2}, \cdots, S_{x_k}$. 


More precisely, $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k}, q}$ is computed in two steps:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Construct a succinctly encoded 2NFA $\Aut'' = ((Q'', \delta''), S'')$, where $Q'' = Q \times Q'$, $S'' = \{((q_0, p), (q, p')) \mid (p, p') \in S\}$, and $\delta''$ comprises the tuples $((q_1, q'_1), a, dir, (q_2, q'_2))$ such that either there is $b \in \Sigma$ satisfying that $(q_1, a, dir, q_2, b) \in \delta$ and $(q'_1, b, q'_2) \in \delta'$, or there is $x_i \in X$ satisfying that $(q_1, a, dir, q_2, x_i) \in \delta$  and $(q'_1, q'_2) \in S_{x_i}$.
%
\item Transform $\Aut''$ into an equivalent succinctly encoded NFA $((Q''',\delta'''), S''')$, where $Q'''$ are vectors of mutually distinct states of $\Aut''$ (cf. Proposition~\ref{prop-2nfa-nfa}),  and $S' = \{(\vec{\rho}_1, \vec{\rho}_2) \mid  (p, p') \in S, \vec{\rho}_1[1] =(q_0, p), \vec{\rho}_2[|\vec{\rho}_2|] = (q, p') \}$.
%
%\item Define $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k}, q}$ as $((Q''', \delta'''), S')$, where $S' = \{(\vec{\rho}_1, \vec{\rho}_2) \mid  (q'_1,q'_2) \in S, \vec{\rho}_1[1] =(q_0,q'_1), \vec{\rho}_2[|\vec{\rho}_2|] = (q, q'_2) \}$.
\end{enumerate} 
It is easy to see that  the size of $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k}, q}$ is at most 
$2^{O(|T||\Aut| \log(|T||\Aut|))}$.   

%For $S \subseteq Q' \times Q'$, let $\Aut[S]$ denote the product of $\Aut(q'_1, \{q'_2\})$ for $(q'_1,q'_2) \in S$ (cf. Section~\ref{sec:prelim}, {Operations of NFAs.}). Since $S$ contains at most $|Q'|^2=|\Aut|^2$ many elements, the size of $\Aut[S]$ is bounded by $|\Aut|^{|\Aut|^2} \approx 2^{O(|\Aut|^2 \log |\Aut|)}$.


\paragraph{Claim.} For each tuple of strings $(w, w_1,\cdots, w_k)$, $(w, w_1,\cdots, w_k) \in \Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ iff there are $S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k} \subseteq Q' \times Q'$ and $q \in F$ such that $w \in \Lang(\cB_{\Transducer, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k}, q})$ and $w_i \in \Lang(\Aut[S_{x_i}])$ for each $i \in [k]$, where $\Aut[S_{x_i}]=((Q', \delta'), S_{x_i})$.

\medskip


Therefore, $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ is a union of
\[\Lang(\cB_{\Transducer, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k},q}) \times \Lang(\Aut[S_{x_1}]) \times \cdots  \times \Lang(\Aut[S_{x_k}]), \]
for $S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k} \subseteq Q' \times Q'$ and $q \in F$. 


We conclude that $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ is a recognisable relation and a representation of $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, whose atom size is bounded by $2^{O(|\Transducer||\Aut|\log (|\Transducer||\Aut|))}$, can be constructed effectively.
\end{proof}

From Lemma~\ref{lem-2pt} and Theorem~\ref{thm-generic-dec}, by some simple calculation, we deduce that the satisfiability of an $\straightline[\twpt]$ formula $\varphi \wedge \psi$ can be decided in 
%nondeterministic 
%$$O((\rcdim(\varphi)+2)^{\rcdep(\varphi)} (f^{\langle \rcdep(\varphi) \rangle}(|\varphi|, |\psi|))^2 \log f^{\langle \rcdep(\varphi) \rangle}(|\varphi|, |\psi|))$$ 
%space, where $f(j, k) = 2^{jk \log (j k)}$. 
nondeterministic $\tower(\rcdep(\varphi), O(|\varphi| |\psi| \log(|\varphi| |\psi|) ))$ space, thus in (deterministic) $\tower(\rcdep(\varphi), O(|\varphi| |\psi| \log(|\varphi| |\psi|) ))$ space, according to Savitch's theorem \cite{Savitch70}. Here $\tower(j, k)$ is a tower of $2$s of height $j$ with $k$ on top, formally, $\tower(1, k)= 2^k$ and $\tower(j+1, k) = 2^{\tower(j, k)}$. We conclude that the satisfiability of $\straightline[\twpt]$ formula $\varphi \wedge \psi$ can be decided in $\rcdep(\varphi)$-exponential space.
Moreover, we have a matching lower bound for the satisfiability of $\straightline[\twpt]$.
%
\begin{theorem}
Given an $\straightline[\twpt]$ formula $\varphi \wedge \psi$, its satisfiability can be decided in $\rcdep(\varphi)$-exponential space. Moreover,  for any $\expheight$, the satisfiability of $\straightline[\twpt]$ is $\expheight$-$\expspace$-hard.
\end{theorem}

The lower bound is proved as follows. \zhilin{@Matt, could you help put your lower bound proof here ?}

%The complexity bound is tight ...

\paragraph{Lower-bound.}

We give a matching lower bound for the satisfiability problem for $\strline[2PT]$. 
In particular, we show the problem is non-elementary.
More specifically, we show that, for any $\expheight$, the problem is $\expheight$-EXPSPACE-hard with $(\expheight+1)$ transducers. More precisely,
we provide a  reduction from a tiling problem that is hard for $\expheight$-EXPSPACE.
The reduction relies on the ability to manipulate large numbers that will be used to index the tiles in a solution to the tiling problem.
Similar encodings appear in the study of higher-order programs (e.g.~\cite{J01,CW07}).

\subsection{One-way transducers}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem-1pt}
Let $\Transducer$ be a 1PT and $\Aut$ be a succinctly encoded NFA. Then $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ is a recognisable relation. Moreover, a representation of $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, whose atom size is bounded by $|\Transducer||\Aut|$, can be computed effectively.
\end{lemma}

Lemma~\ref{lem-1pt} can be proved in the same way as Lemma~\ref{lem-2pt}. The only difference is that the construction of $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \ldots, S_{x_k}, q}$ is simpler and its size is at most $|\Transducer| |\Aut|$, since the transformation from  2NFA to NFA is not needed.

From Lemma~\ref{lem-1pt} and Theorem~\ref{thm-generic-dec}, we deduce the following result.
%
\begin{theorem}
%Given an $\straightline[\owpt]$ formula $\varphi \wedge \psi$, 
The satisfiability problem of $\straightline[\owpt]$ is $\expspace$-complete. 
\end{theorem}

The lower bound in Theorem~\ref{thm-1pt} is deduced from the result in \cite{LB16} that the satisfiability of straight-line string constraints with concatenation and one-way transducers, which are both captured by 1PT, is $\expspace$-complete.


\zhilin{Should we include the lower bound  shown by Matt for concatenation and $\replaceall$ ?}
\begin{remark}
	instantiate the corollary by replace-all. 
\end{remark}

The complexity bound is tight since we can show that $\strline[\replaceall]$ is EXPSPACE-hard. We reduce from EXPSPACE-hard tiling problems.  

%\input{expspace-hardness.tex}

%To show the above result, we will give a constraint that represents a straight-line program which ``transforms'' an automaton into exponentially many different automata.
%These exponentially many automata will be used to check the vertical tiling relation for a tiling problem with an exponentially wide corridor.
%Since such tiling problems are EXPSPACE-hard, the result follows.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-1pt}
	Satisfiability of $\strline[1PT]$, even in the single-letter case, is EXPSPACE-hard.
\end{theorem}
