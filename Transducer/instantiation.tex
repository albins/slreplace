\section{Instantiations of the generic decision procedure}\label{sec-instan}
\vspace{-2mm}

%We instantiate the generic decision procedure presented previously. 
%As in Section~\ref{sec:framework}, 
In our framework each string function $f(x_1, \cdots, x_\arity)$ ($\arity\geq 1$) from the symbolic execution $S$ is modelled by a parametric transducer $\Transducer$  
with $\arity-1$ parameters, and the size of $f$, $|f|$, is naturally defined by the size of $\Transducer$ (i.e., $|\Transducer|$). 
%We shall usually refer to them as \emph{string constraints with transducers}. 
For the pre-image of an FA $\Aut$,  %$\Pre_{R_f}(\Aut)$ 
$f^{-1}(\Aut)$ is instantiated by $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, i.e.,  the set of tuples $(w_1,\ldots, w_\arity)$ such that there is an accepting run of $\Transducer$ on $w_1$ with output $w'\in \Lang(\Aut)$ when the parameters are instantiated with $w_2,\ldots, w_\arity$. To apply Theorem~\ref{thm-generic-dec}, one verifies the regularity condition \prerec{} for the respective class of parametric transducers. %under consideration. 
%While the latter trivially holds as we only consider assertions being regular constraints, the former is not trivial. 
%For the rest of this section, we consider three classes of parametric transducers, viz. two-way transducers, one-way transducers, and reversal-bounded two-way transducers. We shall show that in each case, the pre-image is a recognisable relation with various size bounds $\ell(|\Transducer|, |\Aut|)$. This would yield tight complexity bounds on the path feasibility problem for string manipulating programs $S$ when the string functions therein are given in parametric transducers.  



%the set of tuples $(w, w_1,\ldots, w_k)$ such that there is an accepting run of $\Transducer$ on $w$ with output $w'\in \Lang(\Aut)$ when equipped with the parameters $w_1,\ldots, w_k$.

\subsection{Two-way transducers}\label{sec-2way}
 \vspace{-1mm}

%Let $\Transducer$ be a 2NPT with $k$ parameters $y_1,\cdots, y_k$ and $\Aut$ be an NFA. Then the \emph{preimage} of $\Aut$ w.r.t. $\Transducer$, denoted by $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, is the set of tuples $(w, w_1,\cdots, w_k)$ such that there is an accepting run of $\Transducer$ on $w$ producing an output $w' \in \Lang(\Aut)$, equipped with the parameters $w_1,\cdots, w_k$.


\begin{lemma}\label{lem-2pt}
The  regularity condition  \prerec{} holds for string functions definable in \PPT{}s, with $\ell(|\Transducer|, |\Aut|) = 2^{\bigO(|\Transducer||\Aut|\log (|\Transducer||\Aut|))}$. %, where $T$ is a  \PPT{}, and $\Aut$ is a conjunctive  \FFA{}. 
%Let $\Transducer$ be a \PPT{} and $\Aut$ be a conjunctive \FA{} $\Aut$. Then $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ is a recognisable relation. Moreover, a representation of $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, whose atom size is bounded by $2^{O(|\Transducer||\Aut|\log (|\Transducer||\Aut|))}$, can be computed effectively. Moreover, each disjunct of the representation can be nondeterministically computed in $2^{O(|\Transducer||\Aut|\log (|\Transducer||\Aut|))}$ space.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume a \PPT{} $\Transducer=(X, Q, q_0, F, \delta)$ with $X = \{x_1,\cdots, x_\arity\}$ and a conjunctive \FA{} $\Aut = ((Q', \delta'), \conacc')$ with $\conacc' \subseteq Q' \times Q'$. %We first introduce some notations. 
Let $\oalphabet = \ialphabet \cup X$.

To compute $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, we construct a conjunctive \FFA{} %\footnote{Conjunctive \FFA{}s are defined similarly to conjunctive \FA{}s.} 
$\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity}, q}$, %defined as follows. 
%and $\Aut[S]$ defined below.
%
where  $q \in F$ and  $\conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity} \subseteq Q' \times Q'$.   
%The conjunctive \FFA{} $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k}, q}$ is constructed 
Intuitively this is done from $\Transducer$  by checking for an accepting run of $T$ on $w$ ending at state $q$, and simulating an accepting run of $\Aut$ on the output of $\Transducer$. States of $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity}, q}$ comprise $(q,q') \in Q \times Q'$. 
%In particular, 
When a transition of $\Transducer$ outputs a string $w'$ from $\oalphabet^*$ where some parameter $x_i$ appears (instead of a constant string), for each occurrence of $x_i$ in $w'$, a pair of states $(q_1', q_2')$ is nondeterministically selected from $\conacc_{x_i}$, and the second component of the state of $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity}, q}$ will be updated from $q_1'$ to $q_2'$ to mimic a possible instantiation of $x_i$.  
%\tl{zhilin, I am not quite clear about the para, $y_1$ is a typo of $x_1$? I wrote a para above; please check}
%(instead of materialising the output), where $S_{x_1}$ is used to jump over $y_1$ when $x_1$ is the output of a transition of $\Transducer$, similarly for $S_{x_2}, \cdots, S_{x_k}$. 
More precisely, $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity}, q}$ is defined as
%\begin{enumerate} 
%\item 
%the conjunctive \FFA{} 
$\Aut'' = ((\controls'', \transrel''), \conacc'')$, where $Q'' = Q \times Q'$, $\conacc'' = \{((q_0, p), (q, p')) \mid (p, p') \in \conacc'\}$, and the transition relation $\transrel''$ comprises the tuples $((q_1, q'_1), a, dir, (q_2, q'_2))$ such that there is $w' \in \oalphabet^*$ satisfying that $(q_1, a, dir, q_2, w') \in \transrel$, and either
\begin{itemize}
\item $w' \in \ialphabet^*$  and $q'_1 \xrightarrow[\Aut]{w'} q'_2$, or
%
\item suppose $w' = w'_1 x_{i_1} \ldots w'_{s} x_{i_{s}} w'_{s+1}$ for some $s \ge 1$, $w'_j \in \ialphabet^*$ for each $j \in [s+1]$,  and $i_j \in [\arity]$ for each $j \in [s]$, then there are states $p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{2s+1} \in \controls'$ satisfying that $p_0 = q'_1$, $p_{2s+1} = q'_2$, and 
$$p_0 \xrightarrow[\Aut]{w'_1} p_1 \xrightarrow{\conacc_{x_{i_1}}} p_2\ \ldots\ p_{2s-2} \xrightarrow[\Aut]{w'_s}p_{2s-1} \xrightarrow{\conacc_{x_{i_s}}} p_{2s} \xrightarrow[\Aut]{w'_{s+1}} p_{2s+1},$$ 
where $p_{2j-1} \xrightarrow{\conacc_{x_{i_j}}} p_{2j}$ means $(p_{2j-1}, p_{2j}) \in \conacc_{x_{i_j}}$ for each $j \in [s]$.
\end{itemize}
%
%
%\item Define $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k}, q}$ as $((Q''', \delta'''), S')$, where $S' = \{(\vec{\rho}_1, \vec{\rho}_2) \mid  (q'_1,q'_2) \in S, \vec{\rho}_1[1] =(q_0,q'_1), \vec{\rho}_2[|\vec{\rho}_2|] = (q, q'_2) \}$.
%\end{enumerate} 
It is easy to see that  the size of $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity}, q}$ is at most $|\Transducer||\Aut|$ and $|\conacc''| = |\conacc'|$.   
%$2^{O(|T||\Aut| \log(|T||\Aut|))}$.   

%For $S \subseteq Q' \times Q'$, let $\Aut[S]$ denote the product of $\Aut(q'_1, \{q'_2\})$ for $(q'_1,q'_2) \in S$ (cf. Section~\ref{sec:prelim}, {Operations of NFAs.}). Since $S$ contains at most $|Q'|^2=|\Aut|^2$ many elements, the size of $\Aut[S]$ is bounded by $|\Aut|^{|\Aut|^2} \approx 2^{O(|\Aut|^2 \log |\Aut|)}$.
\smallskip
\noindent
\emph{Claim.} %For each tuple of strings $(w, w_1,\cdots, w_k)$, 
$(w, w_1,\cdots, w_\arity) \in \Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ iff there are $\conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity} \subseteq Q' \times Q'$ and $q \in F$ such that $w \in \Lang(\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity}, q})$ and $w_i \in \Lang(\Aut[\conacc_{x_i}])$ for each $i \in [r]$, where $\Aut[\conacc_{x_i}]=((Q', \delta'), \conacc_{x_i})$. [The proof of the claim is given in Appendix~\ref{appendix:sec-2way}; it crucially relies on that $T$ is functional otherwise it would \emph{not} be correct.]
\smallskip

Thus, $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ is a recognisable relation equal to
\[
\bigcup_{\conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity} \subseteq Q' \times Q', q\in F} \Lang(\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity},q}) \times \Lang(\Aut[\conacc_{x_1}]) \times \cdots  \times \Lang(\Aut[\conacc_{x_\arity}]).\]
%

To represent $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, we transform the conjunctive \FFA{} $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity},q}$ to a union of conjunctive \FA{}s as follows: Transform $\Aut''$ into a one-way transition graph $(\controls''',\delta''')$, where $\controls'''$ are vectors of states of $\Aut''$ of lengths at most $2|\controls''|-1$ (cf. Proposition~\ref{prop-2nfa-nfa}). Then $\Lang(\cB_{\Transducer, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity},q})$ is the union of $\Lang(((\controls''',\delta'''), \conacc''))$ for $\conacc'' \subseteq \controls''' \times \controls''',$ which comprises nondeterministically selected pairs $(\vec{\rho}_1, \vec{\rho}_2) \in \controls''' \times \controls'''$, one for each $(p, p') \in \conacc'$, such that $\vec{\rho}_1[1] =(q_0, p)$ and  $\vec{\rho}_2[|\vec{\rho}_2|] = (q, p')$.
%that is computed nondeterministically from $\cB_{\Transducer, S_{x_1}, \cdots, S_{x_k},q}$ and $S'$ as follows:  For each $(p, p') \in S$, nondeterministically select one pair $(\vec{\rho}_1, \vec{\rho}_2) \in \controls''' \times \controls'''$ satisfying $\vec{\rho}_1[1] =(q_0, p)$ and  $\vec{\rho}_2[|\vec{\rho}_2|] = (q, p')$, then put it into $S''$.

Since the size of each conjunctive \FA{} $((\controls''',\delta'''), \conacc'')$ is $ 2^{\bigO(|\Transducer||\Aut|\log (|\Transducer||\Aut|))}$, we conclude that 
the \prerec{} assumption holds for string functions definable in \PPT{}s with $\ell(|\Transducer|, |\Aut|) = 2^{O(|\Transducer||\Aut|\log (|\Transducer||\Aut|))}$.
%$\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ is a recognisable relation and a representation of $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, whose atom size is bounded by $2^{O(|\Transducer||\Aut|\log (|\Transducer||\Aut|))}$, can be constructed effectively.
\end{proof}

Lemma~\ref{lem-2pt} and Theorem~\ref{thm-generic-dec} entail %by some simple calculation, we deduce that

one can decide the path feasibility of a symbolic execution $S$ with \PPT{}s in

After the result we sketch the lower bound.
%We conclude that the path feasibility of such string manipulating programs  can be decided in $\rcdep(S)$-exponential space.
%Moreover, we have a matching lower bound whose proof is sketched below.
%
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:two-way}
Given a symbolic execution $S$ with \PPT{}s, the path feasibility of $S$ can be decided in $\rcdep(S)$-exponential space. 
%Moreover,  for any $\expheight$, checking path feasibility is $\expheight$-$\expspace$-hard.
\end{theorem}



%========================================lower bound removed==========================================
\OMIT{
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{Lower-bound.}
For each $\expheight$ we reduce from a tiling problem that is hard for $\expheight$-$\expspace$.
For this we need to use large numbers that act as indices.
Similar encodings of large numbers appear in the study of higher-order programs (e.g.~\cite{J01,CW07}) except quite different machinery is needed to enforce the encoding.
The complete reduction is given in 
\shortlong{the full version of this article}
          {Appendix~\ref{sec:two-way-lower}},
with some intuition given here.

A \emph{tiling problem} consists of a finite set of tiles $\tiles$ as well as horizontal and vertical tiling relations 
$\hrel, \vrel \subseteq \tiles \times \tiles$.
Given a tiling \emph{corridor} of a certain width, as well as initial and final tiles
$\inittile, \fintile \in \tiles$
the task is to find a tiling where the first (resp. last) tile of the first (resp. last) row is $\inittile$ (resp. $\fintile$), and horizontally (resp. vertically) adjacent tiles $\tile, \tile'$ have
$\tup{\tile, \tile'} \in \hrel$
(resp. $\vrel$).
Corridor width can be considered equivalent to the space of a Turing machine.

Solving a tiling problem of width $n$ can be reduced to checking whether a \FFT\ of size 
$\ap{\bigoh}{n}$ 
can output a specified symbol $\top$.
Equivalently, we could use a \FFA.
A solutions is a word
$t_{1,1} t_{1,2} \cdots t_{1,n} \numsep \cdots \numsep t_{m,1} t_{m,2} \cdots t_{m,n}$
where $\numsep$ separates rows.
The \FFT\ performs $n+1$ passes.
During the first pass it checks that the tiling begins with $\inittile$, ends with $\fintile$, and
$\tup{t_{i,j}, t_{i,j+1}} \in \hrel$
for all
$1 \leq j < n$.
In $n$ more passes we verify that $\vrel$ is obeyed; the $j$th pass verifies the $j$th column.

Now consider two \FFT{}s and a tiling problem of exponential width.
Intuitively, we precede each tile with its column number in $n$ binary bits.
That is
\[
    0\ldots00\ \tile_{1,1}\ %
    0\ldots01\ \tile_{1,2}\ %
    \cdots
    1\ldots11\ \tile_{1,2^n}\ %
    \numsep
    \cdots
    \numsep
    0\ldots00\ \tile_{m,1}\ %
    0\ldots01\ \tile_{m,2}\ %
    \cdots
    1\ldots11\ \tile_{m,2^n} \ .
\]
The first \FFT{} checks the solution similarly to the width $n$ problem, but needs to handle the large width when checking $\vrel$.
For this it will use a second \FFT.
For each column, the first \FFT{} nondeterministically selects all the tiles in this column 
(verifying $\vrel$ on-the-fly).
The addresses of the selected tiles are output to the second \FFT{} which checks that they are equal.
The first \FFT{} goes through a non-deterministic number of such passes and the second \FFT{} enforces that there are $2^n$ of them (in column order).
To do this, the second \FFT{} checks that after the addresses of the $i$-th column are output by the first \FFT{}, then the addresses of the $(i+1)$-th column are output next.
%\mat{@Zhilin: is above better?}\zhilin{yes!}

With another \FFT we can increase the corridor width by another exponential.
For doubly-exponential numbers, we to precede each tile with a binary sequence of exponential length.
For this we precede each bit with another binary sequence, this time of length $n$.
The first \FFT\ outputs queries to the second, which outputs queries to the third \FFT, each time removing one exponential.
With $(n+1)$ \FFT, we can encode tiling problems over an $n$-fold exponentially wide corridor.

%\subsection{One-way transducers} \label{sec-one-way}


%\begin{lemma}\label{lem-1pt}
%The \prerec{} assumption holds for string functions definable in \PT{}s, with $\ell(|\Transducer|, |\Aut|) = |\Transducer||\Aut|$.
%%Let $\Transducer$ be a 1PT and $\Aut$ be a conjunctive NFA. Then $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$ is a recognisable relation. Moreover, a representation of $\Pre_\Transducer(\Aut)$, whose atom size is bounded by $|\Transducer||\Aut|$, can be computed effectively.
%\end{lemma}

%Lemma~\ref{lem-1pt} can be proved in the same way as Lemma~\ref{lem-2pt}. The only difference is that the construction of $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, S_{x_1}, \ldots, S_{x_k}, q}$ is simpler and its size is at most $|\Transducer| |\Aut|$, since the transformation from  conjunctive \FFA{} to conjunctive \FA{} is not needed.

%From Lemma~\ref{lem-1pt} and Theorem~\ref{thm-generic-dec}, we deduce the following result.
%%
%\begin{theorem} \label{thm-1pt}
%%Given an $\straightline[\owpt]$ formula $\varphi \wedge \psi$, 
%The path feasibility problem of string manipulating programs in SSA form where string functions are modelled by \PT{}s is $\expspace$-complete. 
%\end{theorem}

%The lower bound in Theorem~\ref{thm-1pt} is deduced from the result in \cite{LB16} that the path feasibility of straight-line string constraints with concatenation and one-way transducers, which are both special cases of \PT{}s, is $\expspace$-complete.

\vspace{-4mm}
\subsection{$k$-Reversal-bounded transducers} %and sweeping two-way transducers} 
\label{subsec:krb}
\vspace{-1mm}

 
In practice, many string functions need only a small number of reversals for the reading head, rather than full two-way transducers. 
E.g., the reading head for one-way \PT{} (resp. the string reverse function) needs $0$ (resp. $2$) reversal(s).

Let $k \in \Nat$. A $k$-reversal bounded \PPT{} $\Transducer$ ($k$-\RBPPT{}) is such that in every run of $\Transducer$, the reading direction is reversed at most $k$ times. 
Notice that $k$ must be even since accepting runs must stop on the right end of input strings. 
Evidently, $0$-reversal bounded \PPT{}s are precisely one-way \PT{}s.   


%Therefore, we have: 
%
\begin{lemma}\label{lem-rb2pt}
The regularity condition \prerec{} holds for string functions definable in $k$-\RBPPT{}s, with $\ell(|\Transducer|, |\Aut|) = (|\Transducer||\Aut|)^{k+1}$.
\end{lemma}

From the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem-2pt}, we know that the size of the \FFA{} $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity}, q}$  is at most $|\Transducer| |\Aut|$. Moreover, $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \cdots, \conacc_{x_\arity}, q}$ is $k$-reversal bounded. Therefore, according to the construction of \FA{} from \FFA{}  (cf. \cite{HU79}), we have that the size of each conjunctive \FA{}  in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem-2pt} is at most $ (|\Transducer||\Aut|)^{k+1}$. 

Combing Theorem~\ref{thm-generic-dec} and Lemma~\ref{lem-rb2pt}, we have:

\begin{theorem} \label{thm-rb-2pt}
Let  $k \in \Nat$. The path feasibility of string constraints with $k$-\RBPPT{}s is in 2-$\expspace$. 
\end{theorem}
%
To see Theorem~\ref{thm-rb-2pt}, we invoke Theorem~\ref{thm-generic-dec}. One can observe that the space required by the instantiation of the generic procedure is $\bigO(\rcphi(S)^{k+k^2+...+k^m}\cdot  \rcpsi(S)^{2^m})$, where $m=\rcdep(S)$, which is doubly exponential in the size of $S$. 





%Crucially, symbolic executions where string functions are given by $k$-\RBPPT{}s can be translated to those where string functions are given by only \PT{}s and a special transducer $\Transducer_{\sf reverse}$ for the string reverse function  (cf. Example~\ref{exmp-ft} in Section~\ref{sec:framework}).

%Right-to-left runs are simulated left-to-right, and thus the output must be reversed before concatenation.

We are also interested in the question whether one could obtain lower complexity bounds for more specific string functions. In particular, we will examine \PT{}s, $\Transducer_{\sf reverse}$ (cf. Example~\ref{example:2pt}) and  $\Transducer_{\sf replaceall}$ (cf.\ Proposition~\ref{prop-replace-pt}). To instantiate the generic decision procedure for these functions, we verify the regularity condition \prerec{} for them as follows.
%The  \prerec{} assumption for \PT{}s and $\Transducer_{\sf reverse}$. Indeed,
One may notice that although $\Transducer_{\sf reverse}$ is a two-way transducer, its pre-image does \emph{not} bring an exponential blowup as general \PPT{}s would have. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem-1pt}
	The regularity condition \prerec{} holds for string functions definable in \PT{}s or $\Transducer_{\sf reverse}$, with $\ell(|\Transducer|, |\Aut|) = |\Transducer||\Aut|$.

The proof is the same as Lemma~\ref{lem-2pt} except constructing $\cB_{\Transducer, \Aut, \conacc_{x_1}, \ldots, \conacc_{x_\arity}, q}$ is simpler, with size at most $|\Transducer| |\Aut|$, since the transformation from  conjunctive \FFA{} to conjunctive \FA{} is unneeded. For $\Transducer_{\sf reverse}$, the pre-image is given by reversing the direction of each transition of $\Aut$ and swapping initial and final states.   

Combing Theorem~\ref{thm-generic-dec} and Lemma~\ref{lem-1pt} together, we have:

\begin{theorem}\label{cor-s2pt}
	The path feasibility of string constraints with \FT{}s, replaceall, concatenation, and reverse is $\expspace$-complete.
\end{theorem}
%
%\begin{theorem} \label{thm-s2pt}
%The path feasibility of string constraints with \SPPT{}s is $\expspace$-complete. 
%\end{theorem}

The lower bound is from the $\expspace$-hardness of path feasibility of straight-line string constraints with concatenation and one-way (non-parametric) transducers,  both of which are special cases of \PT{}s~\cite{LB16}.
