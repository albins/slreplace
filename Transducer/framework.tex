\section{The Framework: Transducers, Straight-Line Programs}
\label{sec:framework}

In this section we first review the framework of straight-line programs from
\cite{LB16} for analysing symbolic execution of programs with strings, which
involves capturing ``built-in'' functions using finite-state transductions.
We will then introduce the notion of parametric transducers, and show that
they can capture many other interesting string functions that cannot be captured
within the framework of \cite{LB16}. In particular, this allows us to capture
a string function $f: (\Sigma^*)^k \to \Sigma^*$ with multiple input strings
(e.g. the replaceall function), and the string reverse function. 
The framework of straight-line programs from \cite{LB16} can be adapted
to this new notion of transducers, whose path feasibility problem will be shown
to be decidable in Section \ref{sec:algo}.

\subsection{The ``straight-line'' framework from \cite{LB16}}

The basic straight-line framework from \cite{LB16} involves: (i) instantiating 
the string functions in program assignments by either concatenation of string
variables/constants or an application of a one-way finite-state transducer
to a string variable/constant, and (ii) instantiating conditionals by regular
constraints.

One-way and two-way transducers. Mention what kind of closure/algorithmic
results.

\OMIT{
\begin{definition}[Recognisable relation]
	Given a finite alphabet $\Sigma$, a $k$-ary relation $R\subseteq \Sigma^*\times \cdots\times \Sigma^*$ is \emph{recognisable}  if $R=\bigcup_{i=1}^n L^{(i)}_1\times \cdots\times L^{(i)}_k$ where $L^{(i)}_j$ a regular for each $j\in [k]$ .
%
%	[One can certainly generalise this to $n$-ary relations. ]
\end{definition}
}

\begin{definition}[Two-way Finite transducers]
  Nondeterministic two-way finite state \emph{transducers} (2NFTs) over $\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$ extend NFAs with a one-way left-to-right output tape. They are defined as 2NFAs except that the transition relation $\Delta$ is extended with outputs: $\Delta\subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times \Gamma \times \{-1, +1\} \times  Q $. If a transition $(q, a, b, qâ€², m)$ is enabled on a letter $a\in \Sigma$, the letter $b\in \Gamma$ is appended to the right of
	the output tape and the transducer goes to state $q'$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Parametric transducers}

Introduce one-way and two-way parametric transducers. 

Give examples: htmlescape, replace-all, and reverse.

\subsection{The ``straight-line'' framework}

Give example of computing reverse of DNA string.
