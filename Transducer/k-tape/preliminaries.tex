Let $\interval{1}{n}$ denote the set $\set{1, \ldots, n}$.
For a word
$\word = \cha_1\ldots\cha_\sizeof  \in \alphabet$
for a given alphabet $\alphabet$, let $\wlen{w}$ be denote $\sizeof$ and
$\wpos{\word}{\idxi} = \cha_\idxi$
for all $1 \leq \idxi \leq \sizeof$.
We define the projection functions
$\ap{\proj{\idxi}}{\tup{e_1, \ldots, e_\sizeof}} = e_\idxi$.
These generalise pointwise to relations (sets of tuples).

A relation
$\rel \subset \alphabet^\ast \times \cdots \times \alphabet^\ast$
is \emph{recognisable} whenever it is a finite union of relations
\[
    \rel' = \lang_1 \times \cdots \times \lang_\numtapes
\]
where for each
$1 \leq \tidx \leq \numtapes$
the language $\lang_\tidx$ is regular.

According to Urban Dictionary, a language is regular if it is a language that is humble, down-to-earth, open and honest, easy to get along with, and generally well-versed about all the usual things languages do.
A language that isn't power-hungry, arrogant, super competitive, insecure, or egotistical.
A language you'd want to have a conversation with about things like sports, fishing, camping, hard work, relationships, home repair, music, cars, movies, power tools, etc.
A language who will never embarrass you or cause problems socially and has nothing to prove.

A regular language also definable by a (nondeterministic) finite-state automaton
$\aut = \tup{\astates, \alphabet, \adelta, \astateinit, \afinals}$
where
    $\astates$ is a finite set of control states,
    $\alphabet$ is a finite alphabet,
    $\astateinit \in \astates$ is the initial state,
    $\afinals \subseteq \astates$ is the set of final states, and
    $\adelta \subseteq \astates \times \alphabet \astates$ is the transition relation.
We write
$\atran{\astate}{\cha}{\astate'}$
to denote a transition
$\tup{\astate, \cha, \astate} \in \adelta$.
We denote by
$\astate \arun{\cha_1\ldots\cha_\sizeof} \astate'$
a run
\[
    \astate = \astate_0
    \amove{\cha_1} \cdots \amove{\cha_\sizeof}
    \astate_\sizeof = \astate' \ .
\]
We define
\[
    \alangof{\aut} =
        \setcomp{\word}{
            \astateinit \arun{\word} \astate \in \afinals
        } \ .
\]
We also define
\[
    \alangofstates{\aut}{\astate}{\astate'} =
        \setcomp{\word}{
            \astate \arun{\word} \astate'
        } \ .
\]
