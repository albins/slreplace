\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Strings are a fundamental data type in virtually all programming languages.
Their generic nature can, however, lead to many subtle programming 
bugs, some with security consequences, e.g., cross-site scripting
(XSS) and code injections, both of which are ranked top 10 by Open Web
Application Security Projects (OWASP) in 2017 \cite{owasp17}. 

One effective
method for software testing (and, in particular, automatic test-case 
generation with a good coverage) is based on \emph{symbolic executions} 
\cite{king76} and combinations with dynamic analysis
called \emph{dynamic symbolic execution} \cite{jalangi,DART,EXE,CUTE,KLEE}.
See \cite{symbex-survey} for an excellent survey. Unlike purely random testing,
which runs only \emph{concrete} (i.e. actual) program executions on different 
inputs, the techniques of symbolic executions analyse \emph{static} paths
(also called symbolic executions) through the software system under test.
Since such a path is simply a sequence of assignments and
conditionals/assertions, it can be viewed as a constraint $\varphi$ (over 
appropriate domains corresponding to the data types used in the path) and a 
constraint solver could be invoked on $\varphi$ to check the \emph{feasibility}
of the static path, which can be used for generating inputs that lead to 
an undesirable program behaviour or an exploration of a new part of the
system under test.

Symbolic executions rely on constraint solvers at their core. When the system
under test is a program that use string data type (including most programs 
written in scripting languages like JavaScript and PHP), these techiques 
crucially need constraint solvers over the string domain (a.k.a. \emph{string 
solvers}). This in fact has been one main reason behind the development of
the theory, implementation, and applications of string solving in the past 
decade, e.g., see 
\cite{BTV09,Berkeley-JavaScript,HAMPI,Stranger,Vijay-length,YABI14,Abdulla14,LB16,fang-yu-circuits,Abdulla17,CCHLW18,HJLRV18,S3,TCJ16,Z3-str,cvc4,BCFJKKV08,RVG12,jalangi,expose},
to name a few. \anthony{This list of citations is still incomplete}
