\section{Introduction}

What we hope is two-fold :-
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)]  for a transducer $T$ encoding a string manipulating function $z=f(x;\vec{y})$, suppose that  the output $z$ is constrained by a regular language $\mathcal{A}$, we could compute the pre-image $f^{-1}(\mathcal{A)}$ \emph{as a recognisable relation}. 
	
	\item[(ii)] we have a ``generic" way to solve straight-line string constraints when the ``semantics" of the string operator (function) is a recognisable. 
\end{itemize}

In term of the replaceall function, both (i) and (ii) hold, and indeed the general algorithm framework therein can serve (ii). So the main job is to show that, for each transducer model, the pre-image can indeed give a recognisable relation.

\section{Preliminaries}

Let $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\Nat$ denote the set of integers and natural numbers respectively. For $k \in \Nat$, let $[k] = \{1,\cdots, k\}$. For a vector $\vec{x}=(x_1,\cdots, x_n)$, let $|\vec{x}|$ denote the length of $\vec{x}$ (i.e., $n$) and  $\vec{x}[i]$ denote $x_i$ for each $i \in [n]$.

\paragraph{Graph-Theoretical Notation.} \tl{not sure whether it is really needed; will see}
A DAG (\emph{directed acyclic graph}) $G$ is a finite directed graph $(V, E)$ with
no directed cycles, where $V$ (resp.~$E \subseteq V \times V$) is a set of vertices (resp.~edges).
%. That is, each DAG consists of finitely many vertices and edges, with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that there is no way to start at any vertex $\mathit{v}$ and follow a consistently-directed sequence of edges that eventually loops back to $\mathit{v}$ again. 
Equivalently, a DAG is a directed graph that has a topological ordering, which
is a sequence of the vertices such that every edge is directed from an earlier 
vertex to a later vertex in the sequence. An edge $(\mathit{v},\mathit{v'})$ in
$G$ is called an \emph{incoming} edge of $\mathit{v'}$ and an \emph{outgoing}
edge of $\mathit{v}$. If $(\mathit{v},\mathit{v'}) \in E$, then $\mathit{v'}$ is
called a \emph{successor} of $\mathit{v}$ and $\mathit{v}$ is called a
\emph{predecessor} of $\mathit{v'}$. A \emph{path} $\pi$ in $G$ is a sequence
$\mathit{v}_0 \mathit{e}_1 \mathit{v}_1 \cdots \mathit{v}_{n-1} \mathit{e}_n
\mathit{v}_n$ such that for each $i \in [n]$, we have $\mathit{e}_i =
(\mathit{v}_{i-1},\mathit{v}_i) \in E$. The \emph{length} of the path $\pi$
%$\mathit{v}_0 e_1 \mathit{v}_1 \cdots \mathit{v}_{n-1} e_n \mathit{v}_n$ in $G$
is the number $n$ of edges in $\pi$. If there is a path from
$\mathit{v}$ to $\mathit{v'}$ (resp. from $\mathit{v'}$ to $\mathit{v}$) in $G$,
then $\mathit{v'}$ is said to be \emph{reachable} (resp. \emph{co-reachable})
from $\mathit{v}$ in $G$. If $\mathit{v}$ is reachable from $\mathit{v'}$ in
$G$, then $\mathit{v'}$ is also called an \emph{ancestor} of $\mathit{v}$ in
$G$. In addition, an edge $(\mathit{v'},\mathit{v''})$ is said to be reachable 
(resp. co-reachable) from $\mathit{v}$ if $\mathit{v'}$ is reachable from $\mathit{v}$ (resp. $\mathit{v''}$ is co-reachable from $\mathit{v}$). The \emph{in-degree} (resp. \emph{out-degree}) of a vertex $\mathit{v}$ is the number of incoming (resp. outgoing) edges of $\mathit{v}$. 
%A vertex $\mathit{v}$ in $G$ is said to be a \emph{join} vertex if the in-degree of $\mathit{v}$ is at least two. 
%A DAG $G$ is called an \emph{arborescence} if there is a vertex $v_0$ such that all the vertices are reachable from $v_0$ in $G$, in addition, there are no join vertices in $G$.  
A \emph{subgraph} $G'$ of $G=(V,E)$ is a directed graph $(V', E')$ with
$V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$. Let $G'$ be a subgraph of $G$. Then $G \setminus G'$ is the graph obtained from $G$ by removing all the edges in $G'$.  

\subsection{A collection of automata models}

\begin{definition}[two-way finite state automata]
A \emph{nondeterministic two-way finite state automaton} 
(2NFA) over a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ is a tuple $\cA =
(Q, q_0, F, \Delta)$ where $Q$ is a finite set of states, $q_0\in Q$ is
the initial state, $F\subseteq Q$ is a set of final states, and $\Delta$ is the
transition relation  of type $\Delta\subseteq Q \times \Sigma\times \{+1, -1\}\times Q $. 
\tl{not sure you want to use $\leftarrow, \rightarrow$?}

A nondeterministic (one-way) finite state automaton (NFA)
is a 2NFA such that $\Delta\subseteq Q \times \Sigma\times \{+1\} \times Q $, therefore we
will often write $\Delta\subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times Q$. 
\end{definition}


%A \emph{nondeterministic finite automaton} (NFA) $\cA$ on $\Sigma$ is a tuple $(Q, \delta, q_0, F)$, where $Q$ is a finite set of \emph{states}, $q_0 \in Q$ is the \emph{initial} state, $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of \emph{final} states, and $\delta \subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times Q$ is the \emph{transition relation}. 

For a string $w = a_1 \dots a_n$, a \emph{run} of $\cA$ on $w$ is a state sequence $q_0 \dots q_n$ such that for each $i \in [n]$, $(q_{i-1}, a_i, q_i) \in \delta$. A run $q_0 \dots q_n$ is \emph{accepting} if $q_n \in F$. A string $w$ is \emph{accepted} by $\cA$ if there is an accepting run of $\cA$ on $w$. We use $\Ll(\cA)$ to denote the language defined by $\cA$, that is, the set of strings accepted by $\cA$. We will use $\cA, \cB, \cdots$ to denote NFAs. 
%An NFA $\cA$ is \emph{deterministic} if for each $(q, \sigma) \in Q \times \Sigma$, there is at most one $q' \in Q$ such that $(q, a, q') \in \delta$. An NFA $\cA$ is \emph{complete} if for each $(q, \sigma) \in Q \times \Sigma$, there is at least one $q' \in Q$ such that $(q, a, q') \in \delta$. We assume that all NFA considered in this paper are complete.  An NFA $\cA$ is \emph{unambiguous} if for each word $w$, there is \emph{at most one accepting} run of $\cA$ on $w$.
For a string $w= a_1 \dots a_n$, we also use the notation $q_1 \xrightarrow[\cA]{w} q_{n+1}$ to denote the fact that there are $q_2,\dots, q_n \in Q$ such that for each $i \in [n]$, $(q_i, a_i, q_{i+1}) \in \delta$.  For an NFA $\cA=(Q, \delta, q_0, F)$ and $q, q' \in Q$, we use $\cA(q,q')$ to denote the NFA obtained from $\cA$ by changing the initial state to $q$ and the set of final states to $\{q'\}$. The \emph{size} of an NFA $\cA=(Q, \delta, q_0, F)$, denoted by $|\cA|$, is defined as $|Q|$, the number of states. 

For convenience, we will also call an NFA without initial and final states, that is, a pair $(Q, \delta)$, as a \emph{transition graph}. 


\begin{proposition}
	Any 2NFA is effectively equivalent to an NFA.  
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}[Two-way Finite transducers]
  Nondeterministic two-way finite state \emph{transducers} (2NFTs) over $\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$ extend NFAs with a one-way left-to-right output tape. They are defined as 2NFAs except that the transition relation $\Delta$ is extended with outputs: $\Delta\subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times \Gamma \times \{-1, +1\} \times  Q $. If a transition $(q, a, b, qâ€², m)$ is enabled on a letter $a\in \Sigma$, the letter $b\in \Gamma$ is appended to the right of
	the output tape and the transducer goes to state $q'$. 
\end{definition}



%\tl{Other relevant models such as SST, when appropriate, will be put here.}

\begin{definition}[Recognisable relation]
	Given a finite alphabet $\Sigma$, a $k$-ary relation $R\subseteq \Sigma^*\times \cdots\times \Sigma^*$ is \emph{recognisable}  if $R=\bigcup_{i=1}^n L^{(i)}_1\times \cdots\times L^{(i)}_k$ where $L^{(i)}_j$ a regular for each $j\in [k]$ . 
%	
%	[One can certainly generalise this to $n$-ary relations. ]
\end{definition}



\paragraph{Regular Languages.}
Fix a finite \emph{alphabet} $\Sigma$. Elements in $\Sigma^*$ are called \emph{strings}. Let $\varepsilon$ denote the empty string and  $\Sigma^+ = \Sigma^* \setminus \{\varepsilon\}$. We will use $a,b,\cdots$ to denote letters from $\Sigma$ and $u, v, w, \cdots$ to denote strings from $\Sigma^*$. For a string $u \in \Sigma^*$, let $|u|$ denote the \emph{length} of $u$ (in particular, $|\varepsilon|=0$). A \emph{position} of a nonempty string $u$ of length $n$ is a number $i \in [n]$ (Note that the first position is $1$, instead of  0). In addition, for $i \in [|u|]$, let $u[i]$ denote the $i$-th letter of $u$. 
For two strings $u_1, u_2$, we use $u_1 \cdot u_2$ to denote the \emph{concatenation} of $u_1$ and $u_2$, that is, the string $v$ such that $|v|= |u_1| + |u_2|$ and for each $i \in [|u_1|]$, $v[i]= u_1[i]$ and for each $i \in |u_2|$, $v[|u_1|+i]=u_2[i]$. Let $u, v$ be two strings. If $v = u \cdot v'$ for some string $v'$, then $u$ is said to be a \emph{prefix} of $v$. In addition, if $u \neq v$, then $u$ is said to be a \emph{strict} prefix of $v$. If $u$ is a prefix of $v$, that is, $v = u \cdot v'$ for some string $v'$, then 
we use $u^{-1} v$ to denote $v'$. In particular, $\varepsilon^{-1} v = v$.

A \emph{language} over $\Sigma$ is a subset of $\Sigma^*$. We will use $L_1, L_2, \dots$ to denote languages. For two languages $L_1, L_2$, we use $L_1 \cup L_2$ to denote the union of $L_1$ and $L_2$, and $L_1 \cdot L_2$ to denote the concatenation of $L_1$ and $L_2$, that is, the language $\{u_1 \cdot u_2 \mid u_1 \in L_1, u_2 \in L_2\}$. For a language $L$ and $n \in \Nat$, we define $L^n$, the \emph{iteration} of $L$ for $n$ times, inductively as follows: $L^0=\{\varepsilon\}$ and $L^{n} =L \cdot L^{n-1}$ for $n > 0$. We also use $L^*$ to denote the iteration of $L$ for arbitrarily many times, that is, $L^* = \bigcup \limits_{n \in \Nat} L^n$. Moreover, let $L^+ = \bigcup \limits_{n \in \Nat \setminus \{0\}} L^n$.

\begin{definition}[Regular expressions $\regexp$]
	\[e \eqdef \emptyset \mid \varepsilon \mid a \mid e + e \mid e \concat e \mid e^*, \mbox{ where } a \in \Sigma. \]
	Since $+$ is associative and commutative, we also write $(e_1 + e_2) + e_3$ as $e_1 + e_2 + e_3$ for brevity. We use the abbreviation $e^+ \equiv e \concat e^*$. Moreover, for $\Gamma = \{a_1, \cdots, a_n\}\subseteq \Sigma$, we use the abbreviations $\Gamma \equiv a_1 + \cdots + a_n$ and $\Gamma^\ast \equiv (a_1 + \cdots + a_n)^\ast$. 
\end{definition}
We define $\Ll(e)$ to be the language defined by $e$, that is, the set of strings that match $e$, inductively as follows: $\Ll(\emptyset) =\emptyset$,
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 
$\Ll(\varepsilon) =\{\varepsilon\}$,
%
%\item 
$\Ll(a)= \{a\}$,
%
%\item 
$\Ll(e_1 + e_2) = \Ll(e_1) \cup \Ll(e_2)$,
%
%\item 
$\Ll(e_1 \concat e_2) = \Ll(e_1) \cdot \Ll(e_2)$,
%
%\item 
$\Ll(e_1^*)=(\Ll(e_1))^*$.
%\end{itemize}
In addition, we use $|e|$ to denote the number of symbols occurring in $e$.

%A \emph{nondeterministic finite automaton} (NFA) $\cA$ on $\Sigma$ is a tuple $(Q, \delta, q_0, F)$, where $Q$ is a finite set of \emph{states}, $q_0 \in Q$ is the \emph{initial} state, $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of \emph{final} states, and $\delta \subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times Q$ is the \emph{transition relation}. For a string $w = a_1 \dots a_n$, a \emph{run} of $\cA$ on $w$ is a state sequence $q_0 \dots q_n$ such that for each $i \in [n]$, $(q_{i-1}, a_i, q_i) \in \delta$. A run $q_0 \dots q_n$ is \emph{accepting} if $q_n \in F$. A string $w$ is \emph{accepted} by $\cA$ if there is an accepting run of $\cA$ on $w$. We use $\Ll(\cA)$ to denote the language defined by $\cA$, that is, the set of strings accepted by $\cA$. We will use $\cA, \cB, \cdots$ to denote NFAs. 
%%An NFA $\cA$ is \emph{deterministic} if for each $(q, \sigma) \in Q \times \Sigma$, there is at most one $q' \in Q$ such that $(q, a, q') \in \delta$. An NFA $\cA$ is \emph{complete} if for each $(q, \sigma) \in Q \times \Sigma$, there is at least one $q' \in Q$ such that $(q, a, q') \in \delta$. We assume that all NFA considered in this paper are complete.  An NFA $\cA$ is \emph{unambiguous} if for each word $w$, there is \emph{at most one accepting} run of $\cA$ on $w$.
%For a string $w= a_1 \dots a_n$, we also use the notation $q_1 \xrightarrow[\cA]{w} q_{n+1}$ to denote the fact that there are $q_2,\dots, q_n \in Q$ such that for each $i \in [n]$, $(q_i, a_i, q_{i+1}) \in \delta$.  For an NFA $\cA=(Q, \delta, q_0, F)$ and $q, q' \in Q$, we use $\cA(q,q')$ to denote the NFA obtained from $\cA$ by changing the initial state to $q$ and the set of final states to $\{q'\}$. The \emph{size} of an NFA $\cA=(Q, \delta, q_0, F)$, denoted by $|\cA|$, is defined as $|Q|$, the number of states. For convenience, we will also call an NFA without initial and final states, that is, a pair $(Q, \delta)$, as a \emph{transition graph}. 

It is well-known (e.g. see \cite{HU79}) that regular expressions and NFAs are 
expressively equivalent, and generate precisely all \emph{regular languages}.
In particular, from a regular expression, an equivalent NFA can be constructed 
in linear time. Moreover, regular languages are closed under Boolean
operations, i.e., union, intersection, and complementation.
In particular, given two NFA $\cA_1=(Q_1, \delta_1, q_{0,1}, F_1)$ and
$\cA_2=(Q_2, \delta_2, q_{0,2}, F_2)$ on $\Sigma$, the intersection $\Ll(\cA_1)
\cap \Ll(\cA_2)$ is recognised by the \emph{product automaton} $\cA_1 \times
\cA_2$ of $\cA_1$ and $\cA_2$ defined as $(Q_1 \times Q_2, \delta, (q_{0,1}, q_{0,2}), F_1 \times F_2)$, where $\delta$ comprises the transitions $((q_1, q_2), a, (q'_1, q'_2))$ such that $(q_1, a, q'_1) \in \delta_1$ and $(q_2, a, q'_2) \in \delta_2$.  

\section{String constraints} \label{sec-core}

In this section, we define a general string constraint language that supports 
concatenation, transducers, and regular constraints. 
\tl{for length constraints, let's decide later whether it should be put here}
Throughout this section, we fix an alphabet $\Sigma$.
We consider the String data type $\str$, and assume a countable set of variables
$x, y, z, \cdots$ of $\str$.  


\begin{definition}[Relational and regular constraints]
	Relational constraints and regular constraints are defined by the following rules,
	\[
	\begin{array}{r c l cr}
	s &\eqdef & x \mid u & \ \ & \mbox{(string terms)}\\
%	p &\eqdef & x \mid e & \ \ & \mbox{(pattern terms)}\\
	%t &\eqdef & s \mid e & \ \ & \mbox{(terms)}\\
	\varphi &\eqdef & x = s \concat s  \mid  x = T(\vec{s}) \mid \varphi \wedge \varphi & \ \ & \mbox{(relational constraints)}\\
	\psi & \eqdef & x \in e \mid \psi \wedge \psi %\mid \psi \vee \psi \mid \neg \psi   
	& \ \ & \mbox{(regular constraints)} \\
	\end{array}
	\]
	where $x$ is a string variable, $u \in \Sigma^\ast$ and $e$ is a regular expression over $\Sigma$. 
\end{definition}
\tl{this is not optimal. For $T$ with multiple parameters, the concatenation is redundant}

For a formula $\varphi$ (resp. $\psi$), let $\vars(\varphi)$ (resp. $\vars(\psi)$) denote the set of variables occurring in $\varphi$ (resp. $\psi$). Given a relational constraint $\varphi$, a variable $x$ is called a \emph{source variable} of $\varphi$ if $\varphi$ \emph{does not} contain a conjunct of the form $x = s_1 \concat s_2$ or $x = T(\vec{s})$.

%We then notice that, with the $\replaceall$ function in its general form, the concatenation operation is in fact redundant.

%\begin{proposition}\label{prop-concat}
%	The concatenation  operation ($\concat$) can be simulated  by the $\replaceall$ function.
%\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
%	It is sufficient to observe that %the concatenation operator $s_1 \concat s_2$ is redundant in the sense that 
%	a relational constraint $x = s_1 \concat s_2$ can be rewritten as
%	\[x' = \replaceall(ab, a, s_1) \wedge x = \replaceall(x', b, s_2),\] where $a,b$ are two fresh letters.
%\end{proof}

%In light of Proposition~\ref{prop-concat}, in the sequel, we will \emph{dispense the concatenation operator} mostly and focus on \textbf{the string constraints that involve  the $\replaceall$ function only}.

%Another example to show the power of the $\replaceall$ function is that it can simulate the extension of regular expressions with string variables, which is  supported by the mainstream scripting languages like Python, Javascript, and PHP. For instance, $x \in y^*$ can be expressed by $x =\replaceall(x', a, y) \wedge x' \in a^*$, where $x'$ is a fresh variable and $a$ is a fresh letter. 

 

The generality of the constraint language makes it undecidable,
even in very simple cases. To retain decidability, we follow \cite{LB16} and focus on the ``straight-line fragment" of the language. This straight-line fragment captures the structure of straight-line string-manipulating
programs.  

\begin{definition}[Straight-line relational constraints]
	A relational constraint $ \varphi$ with transducers is straight-line, if $\varphi \eqdef \bigwedge \limits_{1 \le i \le m} x_i = P_i$ such that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $x_1,\dots, x_m$ are mutually distinct,
		\item for each $i \in [m]$, all the variables in $P_i$ are either source variables, or variables from $\{x_1,\dots, x_{i-1}\}$,
	\end{itemize}
	%Occasionally we refer to $x_m$ as the output variable. 
\end{definition}
%Intuitively, in a straight-line relational constraint, the dependency graph (see Definition~\ref{def:dep-graph}) of the string variables is acyclic.
%\mat{forward reference!}

\begin{remark}
	Checking whether a relational constraint $\varphi$ is straight-line can be done in linear time. 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Straight-line string constraints]
	A straight-line string constraint $C$ with transducers (denoted by $\strline[T]$)  is defined as $ \varphi \wedge \psi$,  where 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\varphi$ is a straight-line relational constraint with transducers,  and
		%
		\item $\psi$ is a regular constraint.
		%
	\end{itemize} 
\end{definition}

 
 
 We first introduce a graphical representation of $\strline[T]$ formulae as follows.    
 
 \begin{definition}[Dependency graph]
 	\label{def:dep-graph}
 	Suppose $C= \varphi \wedge \psi$ is an $\strline[\replaceall]$ formula where the pattern parameters of the $\replaceall$ terms are regular expressions. %Let $\vars(\varphi) = \{x_1,\dots, x_m, y_1, \dots, y_n\}$, where $y_1,\dots, y_n$ are  source variables. 
 	Define the \emph{dependency graph} of $C$ as $G_C= (\vars(\varphi), E_C)$, such that for each $i \in [m]$, if $x_i = \replaceall(z, e_i, z')$, then $(x_i, (\rpleft, e_i), z) \in E_C$ and $(x_i, (\rpright, e_i), z') \in E_C$. A final (resp. initial) vertex in $G_C$ is a vertex in $G_C$ without successors (resp. predecessors). The edges labelled by $(\rpleft, e_i)$ and $(\rpright, e_i)$ are called the $\rpleft$-edges and $\rpright$-edges respectively. The \emph{depth} of $G_C$ is the maximum length of the paths in $G_C$. In particular, if $\varphi$ is empty, then the depth of $G_C$ is zero. 
 	%The $\rpleft$-length of a path $\pi$, denoted by $\rpleftlen(\pi)$, is the number of $\rpleft$-edges on $\pi$. A path of $G_C$ is a sequence $z_1 \ell_1 z_2 \dots \ell_{k-1} z_k$ such that for each $i \in [k-1]$, $(z_i, \ell_i, z_{i+1}) \in E_C$. A path is initial (resp. final) if the path starts from an initial vertex (resp. stops at a final vertex).
 	% e the $\src$-nesting-depth of $z$ in $G_C$, denoted by $\srcnd_{G_C}(z)$,  as the maximum number of $\src$-edges in paths from source variables to $z$.
 \end{definition}
 Note that $G_C$ is a DAG where the out-degree of each vertex is two or zero. 
 
\subsection{The satisfiability problem} \label{sec-sat}
In this paper, we focus on the satisfiability problem of $\strline[T]$, which is formalised as follows. 

%\smallskip

\begin{quote} \centering
	\framebox{Given an $\strline[T]$ constraint $C$, decide whether $C$ is satisfiable.}
\end{quote}
\smallskip

%To approach this problem, we identify several fragments of  $\strlineTT]$, depending on whether the pattern and the replacement parameters are constants or variables.  We shall investigate extensively the satisfiability problem of the fragments of $\strline[\replaceall]$. % (see Table~\ref{tab-sum}).  Note that for $x=\replaceall (y, p, z)$, $p$ is referred to as a \emph{pattern} and $z$ is referred to as a \emph{replacement}.

%=========================================================================================================

\section{Two-way transducers}

In this section, we focus on the case where the transducer $T$ has only one parameter, i.e., the relational constraint is of form $x=T(y)$ for example. We will give both upper and low bounds. 

\tl{A question: here there are two ways to present the result, one is to follow \cite{LB16} to encode $\concat$, and the other is to deal with $\concat$ explicitly. Which way do you think is better?}

\subsection{Upper-bound}
We first show that, when the 2-way transducer $T$ and an NFA 


\subsection{Lower-bound}

\section{Two-way transducers with length constraints}

This section is dynamical: we hope for the best of Anothy's result; in case it does not work, we have two possible backups: (1) reversal-bounded 2-way transducers; (2) using reversal-bounded counter machines to represent (both regular and length) constraints

\section{One-way transducers with variables}

Not quite sure whether we need this section, it might be just a simple generalisation of the popl'18 paper, or be subsumed by the next section ; we will see.

\section{Two-way transducers with variables}

\subsection{Pre-image computation of 2-way transducers}  

Let $\vec{y}=\{y_1, \cdots, y_m\}$.

The general idea is to encode a general string manipulating function $f(x, \vec{y})$ as a NFT $T$ over $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma\cup\{\vec{y}\}$. The question for the pre-image computation is formalised as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item INPUT: A NFT $T$, a regular language $\mathcal{A}$. 
	\item OUTPUT: $(L^{(0)}_i, L^{(1)}_i, \cdots, L^{(m)}_i )_{i=1}^\ell$, such that 
	\[\exists z\in\mathcal{A} \wedge z=f(x, \vec{y})\mbox{ iff }\exists k. x\in L^{(0)}_k \wedge y_i\in L^{(i)}_k \]
\end{itemize}

%	The
