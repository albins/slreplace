We write $\wp(\cdot)$ for the Parikh image. The problem is to decide whether there are $\vec{x}$ such that $\wp(f(\vec{x})) \neq \wp(g(\vec{x}))$. The point here is, for $x=\replaceall(y, a,z)$, we have 
\[\wp(x)_a =  \wp(z)_a\]
and, for $b\neq a$
\[\wp(x)_b =  \wp(y)_b+ \wp(y)_a\cdot \wp(z)_b\]

Then it is done. 

The next question is that, can we find an example that $\exists \vec{y}, f(\vec{y})\neq g(\vec{y})$ and $\forall \vec{y}. \wp(f(\vec{y})) = \wp(g(\vec{y}))$. (Trivial example exists: $x=\replaceall(ab,c,y)$ and $x'=\replaceall(ba,c,y)$.)

But we may consider an extended Parikh image, viz, consider the occurrence of $aa, ab, ba, bb$, then it can be detected. The question is whether can %suppose that the source variables have really an impact on the Parikh image. 

\section{Evaluation problem}

Given a straight-line string constraint, the inputs for all the source variables, an index $n$, decide whether the $n$-th letter of the root string is $a$.
